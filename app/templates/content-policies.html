	<p class="callout">The goal of Ashes.live is to foster a <strong>civil and accepting community</strong> in which all Ashes fans can participate.</p>

	<p>Ashes players are generally awesome, so this should mostly take care of itself. However, to make sure everyone is on the same page, here are the official content policies you will be expected to abide by when posting to Ashes.live, which can be summarized as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Stay on topic</li>
		<li>No personal attacks</li>
		<li>No spam</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Additionally, keeping your language kid-friendly is strongly encouraged (low/no profanity, nothing sexually explicit or excessively violent).</p>

	<p>For everything but spam, comments violating the policies below may be deleted or edited without warning. Repeated offenses will lead to a warning via email, and if that is ignored your account may ultimately be blocked.</p>

	<p>I have zero tolerance for spam; comments containing spam will be deleted and the associated user account blocked without warning. If this happens to you and you wish to appeal the block, please <a href="{{ url_for('home.feedback') }}">contact me</a>.</p>

	<h2>Stay on topic</h2>

	<p>I strongly encourage you to keep the discussion on Ashes.live focused on the card game Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn. Discussion about politics, religion, and other divisive topics is likely to be moderated as they have little to do with power-crazed demigods attempting to murder one another in order to absorb the magic of their fallen foes.</p>

	<p>Of all of the guidelines, this is the one that will be least strictly enforced. As long as the discussion remains civil and isn't spam or proslytizing I am liable to leave it alone.</p>

	<h2>No personal attacks</h2>

	<p>Personal attacks include both statements that attack or disparage an individual or those close to them and hate speech. Hate speech is speech that attacks or disparages a group of people based on attribute such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, gender, etc.</p>

	<p>Arguments and disagreements are welcome on Ashes.live, but making it personal is absolutely unacceptable.</p>

	<p>When it comes to hate speech you do not need to be oversensitive about the language you use, but if you are asked to avoid a term or phrase either because it is offensive, derogatory, or hurtful you are expected to do so. Whether you intended to be derogatory or not is unimportant; what is important is that hate speech, even used in ignorance, drives people away.</p>

	<h2>No spam</h2>

	<p>When you post a link, you should be able to answer "yes" to all of the following questions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Is this link directly related to the card game Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn?</li>
		<li>Is this a link to something that you personally use when playing Ashes?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If either question is "no" and you are not posting something innocuous like a silly gif, then your post is liable to be moderated as spam.</p>
