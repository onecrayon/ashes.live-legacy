	<p class="callout">Plaid Hat Games ceased development of Ashes in April 2019. <strong>But the Phoenix will not be denied.</strong> Project Phoenix is a group of die-hard Ashes fans working together to continue development on this wonderful game.</p>

	<h2 class="phg-time-class">Current projects</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Time dice:</strong> Plaid Hat teased a seventh and final dice type on their deluxe expansions, but the game was canceled before Time dice were released. Developing and play-testing a custom implementation of Time dice is one of the main initial goals for Project Phoenix.</li>
		<li><strong>Time expansions:</strong> There are currently two expansions being designed and play-tested using the new Time dice (a mono-Time deck, and a Time/Charm deck).</li>
		<li><strong>New rulings:</strong> The official FAQ includes several counter-intuitive rulings, and sadly failed to define a small number of low-level game mechanics. Project Phoenix is play-testing a revised, more comprehensive ruleset (while maintaining compatibility with the core rulebook).</li>
		<li><strong>Bringing <a href="{{ url_for('ashes_500.index') }}">Ashes 500</a> up to date:</strong> The Ashes 500 alternate deck-building rules are alive and kicking, and Project Phoenix is updating them to cover all released Ashes cards.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Project Phoenix is still in its infancy, so we do not have a specific timeline we can share; however, the above projects have all been under active development even before Plaid Hat announced the official cancellation of Ashes. We hope to keep Ashes fresh for its dedicated fans for a long time to come.</p>
